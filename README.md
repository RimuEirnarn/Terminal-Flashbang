# Terminal-Flashbang
You should not use this repo for the sake of your eyes. i've warned you.

And also, don't take this seriously. Because it is a joke.

## Installation
The installation is easy. You just need Termux and Termux-API installed. And you can choose one of these files.

Soon i may add some files that could work for Linux distributions.

**keep in mind** that this does increase the brightness of your system to the max and restoring it at level/arg 70
